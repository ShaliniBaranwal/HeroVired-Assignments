                        Yoga is an ancient form of spiritual exercise that is
                        performed to better our bodies and minds. Its origins
                        date back as 500 BCE when it was scripted in the Rig
                        Vedas. It is a sacred text of the Hindus. It's believed
                        that yoga was practiced as a form of extreme discipline
                        by the ancient Indian priests. They sat in deep
                        meditation for days without food or water. The
                        modern-day yoga consists of some Asana or poses that can
                        be practiced easily. There are some complex asanas too,
                        which need a lot of practice and flexibility. Yoga is
                        something that people of all ages can practice, be it
                        young or old. Some people even describe yoga as an art
                        form. This is said because of the special skills
                        possessed by expert yoga practitioners. It is advised
                        that you practice yoga on the ground by sitting on a
                        mat.

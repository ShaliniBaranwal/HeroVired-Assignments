                    Yoga is an ancient form of spiritual exercise that is
                    performed to better our bodies and minds. Its origins date
                    back as 500 BCE when it was scripted in the Rig Vedas. It is
                    a sacred text of the Hindus. It's believed that yoga was
                    practiced as a form of extreme discipline by the ancient
                    Indian priests. They sat in deep meditation for days without
                    food or water. The modern-day yoga consists of some Asana or
                    poses that can be practiced easily. There are some complex
                    asanas too, which need a lot of practice and flexibility.
                    Yoga is something that people of all ages can practice, be
                    it young or old. Some people even describe yoga as an art
                    form. This is said because of the special skills possessed
                    by expert yoga practitioners. It is advised that you
                    practice yoga on the ground by sitting on a mat.
